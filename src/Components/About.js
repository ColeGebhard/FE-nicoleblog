                <p>Hello! I’m Nicole Bondurant, a dynamic professional residing in Englewood, CO, with a passion for policy analysis, grant writing, and campaigning, specifically in the fields of climate and animal welfare activism. I’m recognized for my commitment to innovation and my ability to adapt to diverse environments, driven by a profound desire to make a meaningful impact as an environmentalist.</p>

                <p>I’ve acquired substantial experience in both academia and the non-profit sectors, contributing individually and as part of dynamic teams to drive organizational objectives. Whether conducting extensive research, crafting engaging digital newsletters, or generating actionable data reports, my efforts have always been geared towards fostering informed decision-making and strategic planning. I've worked in varied roles, such as Campaigns Intern at Mercy for Animals to being the President of the Annual Climate Conference at Montana State University.</p>

                <p>Educationally, I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Studies with a minor in Political Science from Montana State University and a Graduate Certificate in High-Impact Grant Writing from DePaul University. My competencies include research and organization strategies, data analysis and visualization, public policy, grant writing, and technical and scientific writing.</p>

                <p>Outside of my professional and academic pursuits, I’m an avid lover of the great outdoors, enjoying activities like skiing, snowboarding, hiking, and paddle boarding, alongside my wonderful fiancé, Cole Gebhard. Together, we share our lives with our two amazing dogs, our best companions, reveling in every moment we spend in the beauty of nature.</p>

                <p>I’m thrilled to continue my journey as a fervent climate activist, animal welfare advocate, and environmentalist, striving to create a world where the symbiotic relationship between humanity and nature is cherished and protected.</p>
